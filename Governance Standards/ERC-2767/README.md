# ERC-2767: Governance Token Standard

## Introduction

ERC-2767 is a standard interface for governance tokens and voting systems in Ethereum smart contracts. It provides a unified way to implement token-based governance with off-chain signature collection and on-chain execution.

## Overview

The standard defines a minimal interface for governance tokens while allowing flexibility in implementation details. It focuses on two core aspects:
- Quorum management for governance decisions
- Integration with governance tokens

## Key Components

### 1. Governance Token
- Acts as the voting power token
- Can be transferred between addresses
- Used to determine voting weight
- Integrated with governance decisions

### 2. Quorum System
- Defines minimum votes required for consensus
- Configurable quorum threshold
- Gas-efficient quorum checking
- Dynamic quorum adjustment

## Core Functions

### Token Integration
```solidity
function token() external view returns (address);
```
- Returns the address of the governance token
- Used for voting power calculation
- Essential for token-based governance

### Quorum Management
```solidity
function quorumVotes() external view returns (uint256);
```
- Returns required votes for consensus
- Must be gas efficient (< 30,000 gas)
- Key for governance decision validation

## Governance Process

1. **Proposal Creation**
   - Proposal details are created
   - Includes target address and call data
   - Unique proposal ID is generated

2. **Signature Collection**
   - Governors sign proposals off-chain
   - Signatures include proposal details
   - EIP-191 signature standard used

3. **Proposal Execution**
   - Signatures are submitted on-chain
   - Quorum is verified
   - Proposal is executed if valid

## Security Considerations

### 1. Signature Verification
- Proper EIP-191 signature validation
- Prevention of signature replay
- Ordered signature requirement

### 2. Access Control
- Token-based voting rights
- Quorum enforcement
- Governance token integration

### 3. Execution Safety
- Proposal timeout mechanisms
- Transaction ordering
- Reentrance protection

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Token Integration
```solidity
// Example token integration
IERC20 public immutable token;
mapping(address => uint256) public votingPower;
```

### 2. Quorum Calculation
```solidity
// Example quorum check
require(totalVotes >= quorumVotes(), "Quorum not reached");
```

### 3. Signature Verification
```solidity
// Example signature verification
bytes32 proposalHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(
    prefix,
    proposalId,
    target,
    data
));
```

## Best Practices

1. **Gas Optimization**
   - Efficient storage usage
   - Batch operations where possible
   - Minimal on-chain computation

2. **Security**
   - Comprehensive access control
   - Proper signature validation
   - Safe execution patterns

3. **Upgradeability**
   - Consider upgrade patterns
   - Version control
   - State migration

## Events

### Required Events
```solidity
event QuorumUpdated(uint256 oldQuorum, uint256 newQuorum);
event ProposalExecuted(bytes32 indexed proposalId, address indexed target);
event VoteCast(address indexed voter, uint256 weight);
```

## Extensions

1. **Time-lock**
   - Delayed execution
   - Cancellation period
   - Emergency procedures

2. **Multi-signature**
   - Multiple signature requirements
   - Role-based signatures
   - Weighted signatures

3. **Delegation**
   - Vote delegation
   - Power transfer
   - Delegation history

## Interface Support

### ERC-165 Integration
```solidity
function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) external view returns (bool);
```
- Supports ERC-165 interface detection
- Returns true for ERC-2767 interface ID
- Enables standard compliance checking
